# A function followed by one or more
# lines beginning with a ! means that
# this function might be wrapped
# in a macro with a different signature
# than the function itself. 
# We need to keep track of this for
# parsing the argument types. 
#
# In the specification of this alternative function
# prototype we only care to know which argument is
# the name of the allocated variable. So for 
# the alternative prototypes it is safe to put
# "-1" in the "number" and "size" positions. 
#
# func                number   size   addr
